# Keetro Foundation Membership Agreement

A foundation or a collective is made up of people. These people do things to help the collective make progress towards its goals and mission. Every member joining this specific collective (Keetro.org) needs to acknowledge and subscribe to the basic principles defining the groundwork for effective decision making and operating of the collective:
Not every decision can be made collectively

1. Decisions made by individuals can sometimes be right
2. Individuals are flawed with personal experiences and biases
3. In accordance with these core principles, included below is a new member agreement.

# New Member Agreement

By joining Keetro.org, I, ____________ (insert your name), agree to abide by Keetro.org terms of operation. 

These terms will, from time to time, be amended in order to expand the value provided by the foundation for all of its existing members. The foundation shall not, however, amend the terms if the value to any of its active members diminishes without their agreement. Any such new amendments will not be binding.

In return for becoming a Keetro.org member, you receive a few privileges. These privileges are specifically not defined here to emphasize that the value from any non-profit collective is proportional to the amount of work and service that people put into it.

Despite this, from time to time, your individual participation in the collective will lead to purchase and ownership of various assets (e.g. domain names, hosting services, subscriptions). The collective acknowledges that ownership of such assets is important to the effective functioning of this collective--be that to run web sites, communities, and or other services. Specifically: 
micromanagement of each such service and its operation is not effective when delegated
central ownership of all assets makes the overall operation prone to failure. 

Thus, individuals are empowered to make purchases and become owners of micro-services “as needed”. This means that individual members can expect to receive compensation for their purchase of various assets. The terms of this compensation will vary and be decided on case-by-case basis by other members of the foundation. The one explicit mandatory condition for owning assets as part of the foundation is that “Keetro Foundation” (or Keetro.org) must be specified when registering such a service.

What follows is an agreement by a new member to a collective liability process.

# Member Liability

In order for individuals to own collective assets a few rules must follow:
* Individual owners are not liable for the actions taken by other members of the foundation
* Individuals are liable for their own actions within the collective
This mandates some examples, however it is important to note that the examples below do not constitute a collectively exhaustive mutually exclusive list. Instead, these are only examples necessary for new members to accept the responsibility of owning and operating Keetro assets--a must-have condition for Keetro to survive as a non-profit collective.

# Examples:

Member A owns and operates a subscription to an SMTP service that is provided to the entire collective. Member B, knowingly or not, creates an email campaign that sends massive number of emails through the aforementioned SMTP service. At no point should Member A be considered liable.

Another example involves a 3rd party (a non-member). Let’s say the 3rd party manages to gain access to Member A’s SMTP server. That 3rd party then comprises the system, sending spam to thousands of people. The responsibility in this case lies solely with Member A.
